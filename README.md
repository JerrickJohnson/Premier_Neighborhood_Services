# Premier_Neighborhood_Services

## Description

Premier Neighborhood Services is an application for a community of home owners. Designed to support HOAs in having a one-stop-shop for all information and services for their residents in a sleek, easy-to-use interface. The core functionality of the app consists of secure login and authentication, user marketplace for offering up unwanted items to neighbors, services recommended by the HOA, community event information, messaging with neighbors over marketplace items, and easy payment page for HOA dues. 

The goal is to have an easy demo of the product that could easily be implemented for any HOA that may not have a web application or simply wants to update to a more modern application.
